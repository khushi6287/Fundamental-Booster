# Excel Fundamentals Booster Project 📊

## 📖 Overview
This Excel workbook demonstrates practical applications of essential Excel functions across real-world business scenarios. Designed for intermediate users, it showcases how to combine formulas for effective data analysis, reporting, and decision-making.

## 🏗️ Project Structure
The workbook contains three interconnected datasets:

| Sheet | Purpose | Key Focus Areas |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| **Students Grade** | Academic Performance Analysis | Grading logic, multi-subject evaluation, pass/fail criteria |
| **Sales Data** | Business Sales Tracking | Dynamic discounts, regional analysis, time-based calculations |
| **Employee Data** | HR Management | Department organization, compensation data, date functions |

## 🛠️ Core Excel Skills Demonstrated

### 🔧 **Essential Formulas**
- **Logical Functions:** `IF`, nested `IF`, `AND`, `OR`
- **Lookup Functions:** `VLOOKUP`, `XLOOKUP`, `INDEX`/`MATCH`
